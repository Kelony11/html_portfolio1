<h2>Spiderman:Across the spiderverse(2023)</h2>
<p>It had cool visuals and a very interesting storyline. I really cant wait for the final installment. Highly recommended!!</p>

<h2>Black Panther(2022)</h2>
<p>It was very emotional, 80 percent of the movie was dedicated to Chadwick boseman, the previous black pathner actor who died in 2019 as a result of colon cancer. The movie overall wasn't bad, it's just i dont really like the transition of a main character in a movie. It changes the whole experience for me.</p>

<h2>Guardians of the galaxy(2023)</h2>
<p>I just added this movie here because i ran out of ideas. This movie was one of the most boring franchise in marvel superhero movies, no offense to Chris pratt. i lowkey love him as an actor but i'm glad they concluded the GOTG franchise quick. i dont recommend it, respectfully.</p>
