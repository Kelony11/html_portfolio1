<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Kelvin Ihezue. I was born and raised in Portharcourt city,Rivers State,Nigeria. 
  I moved to the united states of america when i was 14, along with my mom and siblings. 
  I apire to be a software engineer in the future and by accomplishing that, i have to work on 
  my coding skills. </p>

<p> I am currently enrolled in Raritan Valley Community College, Branchburg and i am majoring in 
  computer science. I am one sememster away from completing my associate and transferring to Rutgers 
  to finish up my bachelors. Upon completing bachelors degree, i strive to get my masters as well so, 
  i can be able to get more experience and as well as a financial stability in my coding journey.
</p>

<p> Apart from coding, i have other interesting hobbies such as playing soccer, table tennis,watching good 
  movies and partying. "life is too short", that's my favorite quote. In the meantime, i have bought some useful online 
  courses to stregthen my coding skills and help gain more insights of things that were not properly 
  taught in college. With the certifications from these courses, i'll boost my resume in order for 
  it to be presentable for job seraching. Hopefully, i will complete college in 2026/2027. To know more about 
  me, make sure to contact me, peace.
